 *
 * The following code works on an Attiny85 microcontroller (uC), it
 * hadn't been tested in other uCs.
 *
 * This code listens to the interrupts triggered by the LTC4150 IC
 * and reads from the polarity pin of the same circuit to update
 * the current number of times that the interruption has been
 * triggered to charge or discharge system's battery.
 *
 * An interruption triggered while the POS pin is in LOW state
 * means a discharge status. Meanwhile a HIGH state means a charge
 * status.

 *
 * DIP and SOIC have same pinout, however the SOIC chips are much cheaper, especially if you buy more than 5 at a time
 * For nice breakout boards see https://github.com/rambo/attiny_boards
 *
 * Basically the arduino pin numbers map directly to the PORTB bit numbers.
